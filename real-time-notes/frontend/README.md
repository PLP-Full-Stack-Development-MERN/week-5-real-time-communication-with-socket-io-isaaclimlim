# Real-Time Collaborative Notes

## üìå Project Overview
The **Real-Time Collaborative Notes** application allows multiple users to create, edit, and view notes in real time. Users can join specific rooms to collaborate on a shared note, and changes are instantly reflected for all users in the room. The app is built using:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Express.js + Socket.io + MongoDB
- **State Management**: React Context API

## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ Join a specific "room" via a unique URL or code
- ‚úÖ Real-time collaborative editing using WebSockets
- ‚úÖ Persistent notes stored in MongoDB
- ‚úÖ Notifications when a user joins or leaves a room
- ‚úÖ Display a list of online users in each room (Coming Soon)

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder and add:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

#### **Run the Server**

## ‚ö° Real-Time Concepts Used

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **WebSockets & Socket.io**
- **WebSockets** enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
- **Socket.io** simplifies WebSocket implementation, handling events like `connection`, `joinRoom`, `editNote`, and `disconnect`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Room-Based Communication**
- Users join a specific room using `socket.join(roomId)`, allowing isolated updates per room.
- Notes are stored uniquely per room in MongoDB.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **State Management with React Context API**
- Centralized state for managing notes, room details, and notifications.
- Global access to state ensures efficient UI updates.
